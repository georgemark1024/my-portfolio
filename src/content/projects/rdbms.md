## Project Overview

A custom-built, in memory RDBMS implemented from scratch in Python. I did this project to understand how an RDBMS software works and how SQL commands are translated to specific actions.

## Key Achievements

- Parses SQL like syntax to Python methods
- Implements an innerjoin allowing different tables to be linked and queried as one
- Implements a REPL interface for interaction with the RDBMS

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Language**: Python
<!-- - **Deployment**: Static hosting -->
